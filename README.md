## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learnt how to center div element using flexbox. Made use of HTML element figure for the first time.
Learnt to use svg as an image.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="" alt="" />
</figure>
```

### Continued development

Though I learnt a lot of things in this project, I am still not comfortable in positioning elements. Also I would like to improve on naming elements in a better and more meaningful way.
